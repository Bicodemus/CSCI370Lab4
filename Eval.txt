The intent of our game was to create a 3d environment for a jellyfish to swim around and interact in. The jellyfish can move around the world, and can interact with fish causing them to glow.
Once enough fish have been lit up, the jellyfish must find the starfish to travel to the next level. There isnt too much difficulty, this is more about exploring the world. We designed the worlds
so that they could act as aquariums. There are four walls of glass, each with different types of coral and sad so that it feels like the ocean. There is then a stary night skybox to give the
scenes a darker feel to them. We wanted to take the opportunity to explore the natural strong suits of a 3D environment, including the pretty amazing and beautiful things we could create
with limited assets.



Mitchell:
    This was the first time I have ever worked in a 3d environment, and it was challenging. It was hard for me to understand the worldspace, it just took a lot of time working to figure out
    how to orient myself. It was also a pain trying to figure out how to create materials with all of the different maps. There were several materials that i had to create that did not have 
    spots for some of their maps, so i had to try to find what each map was doing, and where in the material it should go. Although this was a struggle, it was fun for me to work in a 3d environment
    I really enjoyed seeing all of the different aspect come together and work as one. In this game, i worked on creating each of the 3 levels, i got the materials and models for the coral, 
    jellyfish, starfish, sand, and the top of the aquarium. I also worked on 3rd person camera movemment as well as the player movement. 
Morgan: In this project, much of what I was working with was foreign to me. In previous projects, I had worked almost exclusively with just the scripts and mechanics of the core game, ignoring much of the creation of UI, sound effects, and other front-end components. On this game, creation of these components was my primary focus. Getting out of my comfort zone like this was certainly helpful in forcing me to learn these aspects and implement them effectively. It was effective in demonstrating how much difference comes from these aspects that the player directly interacts with. Polish on these aspects makes a huge difference to how the game feels. Though it was difficult to learn all of this new stuff, it was highly satisfying when everything came together, and looked good while doing it.
Cameron: 
    I sure learned a lot during this project. The first thing I learned is that I would love to pursue boids in a different context. That different context being a 2D environment. 3D was certainly
    complicated! I felt like I jumped into a whole new world while working in 3D, and rarely felt like I was extended the materials I had picked up from previous projects. Plus, I found a comfort
    zone in pixel art and was suddently plucked away! But that means I learned a lot that I would not have learned if left to my own devices. A type of game I really want to explore creating
    is a game created in a 3D environment with a 2D "flat" art-style, like the rogue-like Hades. And that game would be built fully in 3D, so I need to keep practicing!
