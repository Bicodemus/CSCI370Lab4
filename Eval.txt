The intent of our game was to create a 3d environment for a jellyfish to swim around and interact in. The jellyfish can move around the world, and can interact with fish causing them to glow.
Once enough fish have been lit up, the jellyfish must find the starfish to travel to the next level. There isnt too much difficulty, this is more about exploring the world. We designed the worlds
so that they could act as aquariums. There are four walls of glass, each with different types of coral and sad so that it feels like the ocean. There is then a stary night skybox to give the
scenes a darker feel to them.



Mitchell:
    This was the first time I have ever worked in a 3d environment, and it was challenging. It was hard for me to understand the worldspace, it just took a lot of time working to figure out
    how to orient myself. It was also a pain trying to figure out how to create materials with all of the different maps. There were several materials that i had to create that did not have 
    spots for some of their maps, so i had to try to find what each map was doing, and where in the material it should go. Although this was a struggle, it was fun for me to work in a 3d environment
    I really enjoyed seeing all of the different aspect come together and work as one. In this game, i worked on creating each of the 3 levels, i got the materials and models for the coral, 
    jellyfish, starfish, sand, and the top of the aquarium. I also worked on 3rd person camera movemment as well as the player movement.
